# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## What's Fixed

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to use the modern GitHub Pages deployment method with proper permissions and authentication. This resolves the `exit code 128` error you were experiencing.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**: Uses the latest GitHub Actions for Pages deployment
2. **Proper Permissions**: Added correct permissions for Pages deployment
3. **Modern Actions**: Updated to use `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4`
4. **Simplified Deployment**: Uses GitHub's built-in Pages deployment action

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository
   - Can be public or private

2. **Push Your Code**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Personal blog site"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically trigger on push

4. **Set Repository Permissions**
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
   - Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
   - Click "Save"

5. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Edit `docs/CNAME` file with your domain
   - Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
   - Add your domain in Pages settings

## Your Site Will Be Available At

- Default: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME`
- Custom domain: `https://your-domain.com`

## Content Updates

To add new articles or update content:

1. Edit `client/src/lib/staticQueryClient.ts` for articles
2. Edit `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` for the "Who I am?" section
3. Run `node build-static.js` to rebuild
4. Commit and push changes

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your updates!

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
- Check that repository has correct permissions
- Ensure all files are committed and pushed
- Verify the `docs` folder is not in `.gitignore`
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
