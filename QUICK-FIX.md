# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for Your GitHub Pages Issue

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages deployment succeeded, but the site shows a 404 error because the files are in the wrong location.

## The Solution
I've already copied the necessary files to your repository root. You just need to commit and push them:

## Quick Steps:

1. **Check that files are in the right place:**
   - `index.html` should be in your repository root
   - `assets/` folder should be in your repository root
   - `.nojekyll` file should be in your repository root

2. **Commit and push these files:**
   ```bash
   git add index.html assets/ .nojekyll
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages files to root directory"
   git push
   ```

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update

4. **Visit your site:** https://geunhwajeong.github.io/

## Alternative: Use the Built Files from docs/

If you prefer to use the files from the `docs/` folder:

1. **Copy files manually:**
   ```bash
   cp docs/index.html ./
   cp -r docs/assets ./
   cp docs/.nojekyll ./
   ```

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add index.html assets/ .nojekyll
   git commit -m "Deploy blog to GitHub Pages"
   git push
   ```

## Why This Works

GitHub Pages looks for `index.html` in the root directory of your repository. The GitHub Actions workflow was putting files in a subfolder, which caused the 404 error.

Now with `index.html` in the root, your site will load properly at https://geunhwajeong.github.io/

## Custom Domain

If you want to use a custom domain later:
1. Create a `CNAME` file in the root with your domain
2. Configure DNS with your domain provider
3. Add the domain in GitHub Pages settings

Your blog should work perfectly now! ðŸŽ‰
